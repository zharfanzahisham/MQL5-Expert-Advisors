# MQL5-Expert-Advisors
This repository contains a list of expert advisors (trading bots) written in MQL5 that I have written myself for experimenting and exploration purposes. I have made these codes available for collaboration purposes. I have yet to refactor some of the codes and upload some new ones. Feel free to reach out to me to discuss about anything :)

## Disclaimer
These bots are not consistently profitable and you **SHOULD NOT** use it with real money. They are still in a very early research phase which is why I don't mind making them publicly available.

## Each EA's Strategy
- CasperBotV1 - This bot is written based on [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WYV5hbrMrw).
- MMXMScalperV1 - This bot uses a modified version of the famous *Next Day Model* by a twitter user called *The MMXM Trader*. Explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klaiq36QnEM).
- NYR50 - An "ICT"-based strategy that trades off of the 50% of the New York range. I believe this strategy was first introduced by a youtuber called *Faiz SMC*.
- ProfectusNDM - I wrote this bot based on my understanding of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBoxwzvtN-Q).
- TaimaScalperV1 - A simple scalping bot that utilises only Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) for entries.
